      <p>Back in Summer of 2016, a group of friends and I traveled to Florida to enjoy our summer,</p>

      <p>by the gate was a giant fake wave, and it was a perfect photo op,</p>

      <p>especially for photos like this...</p>
      <img src = "images/pairsurf.gif" width = 750px title = "Re-enacting the Titanic">
      <p>There were many places to visit and rides to go on,</p>
      <img src = "images/jpark.jpg" width = 750px title = "Jurassic Park">
      <p> such as Jurassic Park... </p>
      <img src = "images/sisland.jpg" width = 750px title = "Skull Island">
      <p> and Skull Island.</p>
      <p> The most notable place of all, however, was Diagon Valley from Harry Potter</p>
      <img src = "images/grin.jpg" width = 450px title = "Gringott's Dragon">
      <p>Where the Gringott's Dragon breathes its fire among the visitors.</p>
      <img src = "images/dragfront.gif" width = 450px title = "Gringott's Dragon">
      <p>We managed to time the interval of its fire breathing and got some great footages.</p>
      <img src = "images/dragside.gif" width = 750px title = "Gringott's Dragon">

      <p>For the second part of our trip we went to Disneyland. As I took this photo i realized that using with a bit of editing this could totally be a evil castle.</p>

      <p> Ditto.</p>
      <img src = "images/pooh.jpg" width = 450px title = "Winnie the Pooh and Me">
